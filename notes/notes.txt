1) routing setup
    -for sidebar: instead of trying to pass events array to index route, create nested routes:
        <Sidebar events=events />
            The sidebar can receive props this way?  This wouldn't require nested routing, just component props, so try this first
        If that doesn't work, try nested routes for sidebar (current, past, new)

2) sign in/sign up form
    -component for each, swap between on button click?  allow login with fb? set user level to 'user' as default (i can update later via firebase)
3) link to firebase
    -map out schema first
        -main obj: events
            -sub: event
                -title, desc, image, created date, created by, edited date, edited by
                -sub: posts
                    -title, text, img?, created on, created by, edited on, edited by, approved, comments
                -sub of posts: comments
                    -type (text, like, dislike), text (if like/dislike- this is the icon html string?), created on, create by, approved
        -main obj: users
            -email(username), password(hashed- by firebase?), level (root, admin, user) added on, last login
4) using basic confirm modal for confirming delete- make custom modal and function return boolean to handle this.
5) security: only user with root level can delete events, only user with admin level can add/edit events.  user with user level can view events
6) re-org base level: Header is currently outside app, but will need access to routing for home/profile links
7) fix formatting
8) fix 'add new event' formatting (button, image upload, drag/drop?, details field- how?)
    -better answer might be modal for add new (add new card is just large plus box- click it to open modal and add event)
