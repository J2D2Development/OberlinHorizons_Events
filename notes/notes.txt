1) routing setup
    -getting it from firebase for now- probably not the best way, but seems to work.  using 'link' as index as it's the only thing passed by react-router
    -need to figure this out- can't pass functions down via firebase- has to be done via props.  need to pass props to another component via react-router
2) sign in/sign up form
    -component for each, swap between on button click?  allow login with fb? set user level to 'user' as default (i can update later via firebase)
3) link to firebase
    -map out schema first
        -main obj: events
            -sub: event
                -title, desc, image, created date, created by, edited date, edited by
                -sub: posts
                    -title, text, img?, created on, created by, edited on, edited by
        -main obj: users
            -email(username), password(hashed- by firebase?), level (root, admin, user) added on, last login
4) using basic confirm modal for confirming delete- make custom modal and function return boolean to handle this.
5) security: only user with root level can delete events, only user with admin level can add/edit events.  user with user level can view events
6) re-org base level: Header is currently outside app, but will need access to routing for home/profile links
7) fix card formatting (mobile and ipad breakpoints)
8) fix 'add new event' formatting (button, image upload, drag/drop?, details field- how?)
    -better answer might be modal for add new (add new card is just large plus box- click it to open modal and add event)
