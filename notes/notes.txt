1) routing setup
    -still can't get this bullshit to work.  trying to sync up firebase with eventdetails.js container component.  works on one component, but then state never fucking updates when navigating to different routes.  FUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCKFUCK
    -another option: use first setup you tried, but have eventDetails.js be a container component- it can access state?
2) sign in/sign up form
    -component for each, swap between on button click?  allow login with fb? set user level to 'user' as default (i can update later via firebase)
3) link to firebase
    -map out schema first
        -main obj: events
            -sub: event
                -title, desc, image, created date, created by, edited date, edited by
                -sub: posts
                    -title, text, img?, created on, created by, edited on, edited by
        -main obj: users
            -email(username), password(hashed- by firebase?), level (root, admin, user) added on, last login
4) using basic confirm modal for confirming delete- make custom modal and function return boolean to handle this.
5) security: only user with root level can delete events, only user with admin level can add/edit events.  user with user level can view events
6) re-org base level: Header is currently outside app, but will need access to routing for home/profile links
7) fix card formatting (mobile and ipad breakpoints)
8) fix 'add new event' formatting (button, image upload, drag/drop?, details field- how?)
    -better answer might be modal for add new (add new card is just large plus box- click it to open modal and add event)
