0) deleting event doesn't update ui
    -event is deleted from state and from firebase, but ui doesn't update until hard refresh?
1) clean up event formatting
    -comments smaller
    -date/creator larger
1.5) add large calendar to home route:
    http://intljusticemission.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html
    -working well for now, might update formatting soon.
2) sign in form
    -close: add hover animation to arrow (translateX) or on password field min length reached?
2.5) sign up form
    -set user level to 'user' as default (i can update later via firebase)
3) link to firebase
    -map out schema first
        -main obj: events
            -sub: event
                -title, desc, image, created date, created by, edited date, edited by
                -sub: posts
                    -title, text, img?, created on, created by, edited on, edited by, approved, comments
                -sub of posts: comments
                    -type (text, like, dislike), text (if like/dislike- this is the icon html string?), created on, create by, approved
        -main obj: users
            -email(username), password(hashed- by firebase?), level (root, admin, user) added on, last login
4) using basic confirm modal for confirming delete- make custom modal and function return boolean to handle this.
5) security: only user with root level can delete events, only user with admin level can add/edit events.  user with user level can view events
7) login validation
8) fix 'add new event' formatting
    -datepicker too big vertically
    -shrink header
    -bigger 'details' field
    -add 'default image' optional upload field
    -'add users to this event' option?
9) edit event functionality
10) loading screen
    -simple overlay for now, only on did mount hook.  Need to make function to call when hiding loader (or showing?).  set isLoading to true when getting data, isLoading to false when didmount or when data 'get' callback/.then completes.
11) profiles
    -route created, just need to include form for edtiing email, password, display name, picture
