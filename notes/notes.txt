1) routing setup
    -pass along necessary info to final event view?  or get it from firebase?  best way to get those details (all posts, pics, comments for that individual event)
2) sign in/sign up form
    -component for each, swap between on button click?  allow login with fb?
3) link to firebase
    -map out schema first
        -main obj: events
            -sub: event
                -title, desc, image, created date, created by, edited date, edited by
                -sub: posts
                    -title, text, img?, created on, created by, edited on, edited by
        -main obj: users
            -email(username), password(hashed- by firebase?), added on, last login
