0) deleting event doesn't update ui
    -event is deleted from state and from firebase, but ui doesn't update until hard refresh?
1) clean up event formatting
    -comments smaller
    -date/creator larger
1.5) add large calendar to home route:
    http://intljusticemission.github.io/react-big-calendar/examples/index.html
    -working well for now, might update formatting soon.
2) sign in form
    -close: add hover animation to arrow (translateX) or on password field min length reached?
2.5) sign up form
    -set user level to 'user' as default (i can update later via firebase)
3) link to firebase
    -map out schema first
        -main obj: events
            -sub: event
                -title, desc, image, created date, created by, edited date, edited by
                -sub: posts
                    -title, text, img?, created on, created by, edited on, edited by, approved, comments
                -sub of posts: comments
                    -type (text, like, dislike), text (if like/dislike- this is the icon html string?), created on, create by, approved
        -main obj: users
            -email(username), password(hashed- by firebase?), level (root, admin, user) added on, last login
4) using basic confirm modal for confirming delete- make custom modal and function return boolean to handle this.
5) security: only user with root level can delete events, only user with admin level can add/edit events.  user with user level can view events
7) login validation
8) fix 'add new event' formatting
    -datepicker too big vertically
    -shrink header
    -bigger 'details' field
    -add 'default image' optional upload field
    -'add users to this event' option?
9) edit event functionality
10) loading screen
