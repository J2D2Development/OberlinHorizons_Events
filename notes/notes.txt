1) routing setup
    -this is the fucking dumbest thing react does.  you can't pass props to a route, so it's completely fucking pointless to use the goddamn router.  best option: rewrite the entire fucking thing.  Everything is inside the router (bootstrap the Root component).  Then have a 'layout' component and include a header in that, have a sidebar component and include your event titles in that, have a 'main' component and include your event details in that.  in header, have links for profile and home and user setup (if admin status).

    -another option: use first setup you tried, but have eventDetails.js be a container component- it can access state?
2) sign in/sign up form
    -component for each, swap between on button click?  allow login with fb? set user level to 'user' as default (i can update later via firebase)
3) link to firebase
    -map out schema first
        -main obj: events
            -sub: event
                -title, desc, image, created date, created by, edited date, edited by
                -sub: posts
                    -title, text, img?, created on, created by, edited on, edited by
        -main obj: users
            -email(username), password(hashed- by firebase?), level (root, admin, user) added on, last login
4) using basic confirm modal for confirming delete- make custom modal and function return boolean to handle this.
5) security: only user with root level can delete events, only user with admin level can add/edit events.  user with user level can view events
6) re-org base level: Header is currently outside app, but will need access to routing for home/profile links
7) fix card formatting (mobile and ipad breakpoints)
8) fix 'add new event' formatting (button, image upload, drag/drop?, details field- how?)
    -better answer might be modal for add new (add new card is just large plus box- click it to open modal and add event)
